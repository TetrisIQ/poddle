## What means decentralized

## FAQ
### Why can nobody see my poll?
Maybe you close your browser window, so that your participants cannot receive the data from you.   
Poll dApp has no central server so your data are only stored in your browser (and in the browser of your Participants)

> If you have any other issues, create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/TetrisIQ/poll-dapp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)

## Installation
- Clone the git repo
- Install the dependency's with `yarn install`
- Start the application `yarn dev`
